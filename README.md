## Features

<br>

- Easy to use music player application.

- Simple and Intuitive UI design, i.e.&ensp;**_less code but more attractive_**.

- Editable `music-list.js` file along with songs and images folder respectively to play songs according to your mood.

- Backend can be connected so that more songs can be added directly to the music list without actually changing anything in the code.

- You can also change the song to play in three different loops, i.e. Playlist looped, Song looped and Playback shuffled.

- You can play the desired song directly from the music list present in the music-player itself.

1. Clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/priyanshu-baran/Music_Player_Application.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and open the index.html file in your browser.

> cd Music_Player_Application

> **_Recommend:_** I will recommend using [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) here as it will help you a lot while working with .htm or .html files.

3. Play the song by clicking the "Play" button and then enjoy with your brand new personal music player.
